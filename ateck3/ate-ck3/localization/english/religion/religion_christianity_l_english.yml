 #Catholic-Group Faiths
 catholic:0 "Catholicism"

 catholic_adherent:0 "Catholic"
 catholic_adherent_plural:0 "Catholics"
 catholic_desc:0 "Catholicism is one of the oldest branches of Christianity, and it survived the cataclysmic events of centuries past by the skin of its teeth. After the Deluge, the surviving Catholic hierarchy in America received word of a divine apparition that confirmed the destruction of the Papacy in Rome and gave the surviving American cardinals the right to elect a new Bishop of Rome from their number. The new American Popes lacked a permanent temporal seat for centuries - a period known as "the Wandering Papacy" - until control over the old city of St. Louis in Missouri was finally established in the late 24th century. Because of its association with the Papacy, St. Louis earned the nickname "New Rome", although this term is not officially used by the Catholic Church. The formal head of the religion is the Bishop of Rome - the Pope."

 neognostic_desc:0 "Neo-Gnostism reemerged in Colorado as a syncretic faith combining teachings coming from the Harmonic faiths of the West and the Christian East. Neo-Gnostics have amalgamated the belief in the Christian God, who they call "The One" with the rejection of materialism often found in Harmonic schools of thought. They believe that Salvation can be found in worship of Christ and that they can find Enlightenment through his teachings. Gnostics see material posessions and desires as secondary to Oneness with God. They reject the material world as being the work of Satan and seek to embrace the 'Gnosis', or knowledge of God."

 ursuline_adherent:0 "Ursuline"
 ursuline_adherent_plural:0 "Ursulines"
 ursuline_desc:0 "The Ursulines originated as an antediluvian religious order, patronized by Saint Ursula. After the Deluge, most Quebecois Catholics turned to the Ursuline Order for guidance. Although their outsized role in Quebecois religious life was initially tolerated by the Catholic Church, the entire order and all of its followers were excommunicated following an attempt by the Ursulines to elect one of their own to the Papacy. In response, the Ursuline Order formally split from the Catholic Church. The current position of the Ursulines is that none of the Christian bishops currently operating in the Americas have proper apostolic succession, and that members of sanctioned religious orders can serve as de facto clergy until bishop-level apostolic succession is re-established."

However, some Christians chafe against the doctrines and restrictions imposed by this Convention..."

 charismaticism_adherent:0 "Neo-Charismatic"
 charismaticism_adherent_plural:0 "Neo-Charismatics"
 charismaticism_desc:0 "Neo-Charismatics are not known as such because of their charm, but rather their belief in 'charismata', gifts of the Holy Spirit manifested in miracles and signs that can be endowed simply by baptism and faith in the Holy Spirit. Considering themselves to carry the Third Wave of the Holy Spirit beyond traditional Charismatics, they believe in wonders including the ability to speak in tongues, miraculous healing of the cripples, gifts of prophecy and more events often considered 'supernatural', and desire a structural renewal where apostles and prophets will lead the church to the Kingdom of God. Although the Evangelical Convention declared these beliefs heretical, the Charismatic faith continues to thrive outside the jurisdiction of the Holy Columbian Confederacy."

 anglican:0 "Anglicanism"
 anglican_adj:0 "Anglican"
 anglican_adherent:0 "Anglican"
 anglican_adherent_plural:0 "Anglicans"
 anglican_desc:0 "Anglicanism describes itself as being a 'via media', or middle way, between Evangelical Protestantism and the Catholic Church. Following the Deluge, the Anglican Church in Canada refused to participate in the Evangelical Convention called by the churches in the Deep South, becoming recognized as a separate faith unto itself. It quickly became widespread in the former Anglophone provinces of Canada, as its pluralistic teachings and tolerance for both Protestant and Catholic practices made it attractive to Canadians from all backgrounds. The highest authority in Anglicanism is the Archbishop of New Canterbury."

 anabaptist_desc:0 "The Anabaptists are a branch of Christianity originating from 16th century Europe, and are the forebears of American groups such as the Amish, Hutterites and Mennonites, who banded together to survive the post-cataclysm world. Anabaptists believe Christians should remain separate from the rest of the world, refuse to hold office, and refrain from violence except when absolutely necessary. These tenets make life after the apocalypse difficult and often quite short."

 batenburger_adj:0 "Batenburger"
 batenburger_adherent:0 "Batenburger"
 batenburger_adherent_plural:0 "Batenburgers"
 batenburger_desc:0 "Batenburgers are a particularly violent group of Christians that emerged following the invasion of Anabaptist lands by Americanists. Followers of Batenburgism believe that the invasion was a sign that the doctrine of pacifism was to be abandoned entirely, rather than being merely relaxed. Followers of other Christian faiths condemn these heretics for their maintenence of harems and their tendency to violently raid the homes of non-believers."

 insular_carribean_adherent_plural:0 "Insularists"
 insular_carribean_desc:1 "When contact with Rome was lost, the Catholics of the Caribbean mostly retained their faith and did not recognize a new head. Instead, the various archdioceses began to administer the church according to their local authority an Insula, or island community, with their own rites. These rites, amounting to almost full canons, contain both functional law and local saints. Although they theoretically are pending approval by the Pope in Rome, they are treated as valid in his absence. Most lay practitioners trust that their bishops do their due diligence and consider their local traditions to be in line with mainstream Catholicism. Other Catholics would note that many Insular Christians venerate 'African saints' that are suspiciously similar to figures from other nearby religions."

 falling_star_adherent_plural:0 "Starmen"
 falling_star_desc:0 "Sometime either during or just after the Deluge, the Church of the Falling Star believes a star fell from the heavens and onto Earth. This star was a fallen Angel who had sacrificed themselves to save mankind from God's wrath, explaining humanity's survival. 'Starmen' are generally viewed with suspicion by some with more traditional Christian beliefs, as the concept of Fallen Angels is generally associated with Satan. However, the Starmen insist their angel has little in common with the fallen Angel Lucifer, and that their angel's compassion reawakened God's mercy in a moment of anger. Thus, the Church of the Falling Star is still normatively Christian, albeit with a liturgy that features great devotion to their fallen 'star'."
