 judaism_religion_desc:0 "Judaism is the oldest of the Abrahamic religions, and it survived the Event as it did so many other catastrophes. The uniting thread of Judaism is the belief in a single, undivided God, who appeared to Abraham, Issac, and Jacob. These three patriarchs are, in turn, the spiritual ancestors of the Jewish people, whose unique covenant with God compels them to live by His laws and teachings."

 reform_adherent_plural:0 "Reform Jews"
 reform_desc:0 "Reform Judaism emerged before the Event, and its ideas have persisted in Jewish communities across the centuries. Reform Jews believe that Halakha, or Jewish religious law, is non-binding. They instead believe that each Reform Jew has the autonomy to interpret and practice Judaism as they see fit. Reform Jews do not believe in the imminent arrival of Moshiach, and are instead devoted to the principle of Tikkun Olam, or repair of the world. This principle holds that each Reform Jew must work to restore the pre-Event world through collective effort and force of will."

 meshichist_desc:0 "Meshichism emerged as a distinct branch of the Jewish religion in the chaos following the Event. Meshichists believe that the last great pre-Event Haredi Rebbe is actually Moshiach. The notion of a dead man being Moshiach would contradict most Jewish teachings on this issue, but Meshichists claim that 'the Rebbe' is still 'alive' in a metaphorical sense. Meshichists also place a great deal of importance on the more mystical and esoteric aspects of Jewish belief."
